  description: 'Outputs a PCollection of Beam Rows, each containing a single INT64
    number called "value". The count is produced from the given "start" value and
    either up to the given "end" or until 2^63 - 1.

    To produce an unbounded PCollection, simply do not specify an "end" value. Unbounded
    sequences can specify a "rate" for output elements.

    In all cases, the sequence of numbers is generated in parallel, so there is no
    inherent ordering between the generated values'
